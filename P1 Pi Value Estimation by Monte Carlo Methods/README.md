# Project 1) Pi Value Estimation by Monte Carlo Methods
 
What is a Monte Carlo Method?: the method that relies on repeated random sampling to obtain numerical results. Basic idea is using randomness to solve problems that might be deterministic in principle. Design a function to estimate pi value from one unit circle (NOT one quarter). Briefly descript the basic process of proposed method in one page.
